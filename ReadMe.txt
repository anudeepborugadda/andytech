Hello Frank,

Console application has been created with name "ConsoleAppHelloWorld" for the "Hello World".

Simple WebAPI has been created with name "WebAPI" which eventually supports all the applications.

The same API has been invoked from a TestEmployee.html page using Jquery in the same project. It has two funtions one brings all the employees and the second it bring the emloyee details by its id.

The same API has been involed from Console Application as well.

Whenever you want to execute either Console App or the Web App please go to Solution properties and make the appropriate project as the start up project and then Press F5.

Let me know if there are any concerns.

Thanks
Anudeep.
